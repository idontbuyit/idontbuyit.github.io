# #IDontBuyIt

#### #IDontBuyIt is the idea that as informed citizens, it is our duty to remove the financial incentive for false, misleading, polarizing, fake or alarmist news and instead support balanced, fair, investigative journalism.

## How does this work?

As an organized group centered around a common goal, we will do the following things to make it financially unwise to advertise on disreputable outlets:

- We will conduct educational campaigns raising awareness that these companies are financially supporting organizations who spread propaganda and misinformation, and underreport or suppress the truth.
- We will boycott these companies and urge our friends, family, coworkers and people in our social media circles to do the same.
- We will offer alternatives to these low-quality news sources and provide people with the tools to critically evaluate sources of news.

## What are some resources I can use to do my part?
